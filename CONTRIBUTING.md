# Contributing Guidelines

## Commit Message Rules

- Never include listener names, usernames, or personal details in commit messages
- Never reference private feedback, DMs, or emails as a reason for a change
- Keep commit messages generic and descriptive of what changed, not why
- Examples: "Updated stories page", "Added new episode listing" — not "Added shoutout for [name] per listener request"

## Listener Data

- Listener names or personal details may appear in published page content (e.g. shoutouts) only if explicitly consented to
- They must never appear in commit messages, code comments, or file names
- If a change is inspired by listener feedback, the commit message should not reference the feedback or the listener

## AI-Generated Changes

- All AI-generated commits must follow the rules above before being pushed
- When prompting an AI to make changes, include: "Follow the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md"
