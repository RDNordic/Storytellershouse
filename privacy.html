      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>
      <p>
        The Storyteller’s House respects your privacy and is committed to being transparent
        about the information we do—and do not—collect. This policy outlines how we handle
        personal data when you interact with our website.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect or store personal data when you browse this website. The only
        personal information we receive is what you choose to share with us directly
        through email or other messages.
      </p>

      <h2>Email Communications</h2>
      <p>
        If you send us an email, we will use the information you provide solely to respond
        to your message. We retain your email address and the contents of the conversation
        only for as long as the communication remains active. Once the conversation ends,
        we delete the correspondence and any personal details it contains.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        We do not use cookies, analytics scripts, or any other tracking technologies on
        this website.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share personal information with third parties, and we do not use external
        analytics or advertising services. Our web hosting provider may collect standard
        technical logs (such as IP addresses) required for security and maintenance, but
        we do not access or store that information.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable steps to protect any personal information you share with us from
        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Storyteller’s House is designed for audiences of all ages. We encourage parents
        and guardians to supervise children’s use of the internet and to contact us if they
        believe a child has provided personal information without consent so we can remove it.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes to our
        practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we make
        changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about this policy or how we handle your information,
        please reach out through the form on our <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.
